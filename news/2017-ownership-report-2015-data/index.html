INTRODUCTION<br />
This report presents data on ownership interests in commercial broadcast stations as of October 1, 2015.1  The report contains:  (1) an overview of the major findings from the 2015 broadcast ownership data presented by gender, ethnicity, and race; (2) a comparison of 2015 and 2013 data in key categories for full power commercial television, Class A television, low-power television (LPTV), commercial AM radio, and commercial FM radio stations; and (3) more detailed information provided both in the attached tables in the appendix and in accompanying spreadsheets released in conjunction with this report.2<br />
The Federal Communications Commission biennial commercial broadcast ownership reporting form, FCC Form 323, is designed to obtain comprehensive data on racial and ethnic minority and female broadcast ownership—statistically valid broadcast ownership data that can be compiled and aggregated and used as a source for further analysis.  The Commission requires all full power commercial television and radio broadcast stations and low power and Class A television stations to file biennial ownership reports using the same “as of” date (October 1) for reported data during each filing cycle.3  A station’s </p>
<p>1	Previous versions of this report were released in various dockets related to the Commission’s media ownership rules and diversity initiatives.  See 2014 Quadrennial Regulatory Review – Review of the Commission’s Broadcast Ownership Rules and Other Rules Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, MB<br />
Docket Nos. 14-50, 09-182, and 07-294, Report on Ownership of Commercial Broadcast Stations, 29 FCC Rcd 7835 (MB 2014) (Second 323 Report) (This was the second 323 report issued by the Media Bureau and presented data for the 2013 filing cycle.); 2010 Quadrennial Regulatory Review – Review of the Commission’s Broadcast Ownership Rules and Other Rules Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, MB Docket Nos.<br />
09-182 and 07-294, Report on Ownership of Commercial Broadcast Stations, 27 FCC Rcd 13814 (MB 2012) (First 323 Report) (This was the first report on Form 323 data issued by the Media Bureau and presented data for the 2009 and 2011 filing cycles.).  While the data in this report may be particularly relevant to Commission policymaking in those areas, this data may also be useful in a wide variety of additional proceedings.  Accordingly, the Commission will no longer release these reports in a particular docket.<br />
2	The accompanying spreadsheets present ownership characteristics for each broadcast station, identified by its Facility ID.  In a separate spreadsheet, we also provide the current call sign for each broadcast station.  We note that the data contained in each Form 323 ownership report are publicly available and may be downloaded from the Commission’s Consolidated Database (CDBS) and then aggregated, cross-referenced, and searched electronically.  See <a href="http://licensing.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/cdbs_pa.htm">http://licensing.fcc.gov/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/cdbs_pa.htm</a>.<br />

In 2016, the Commission revised the Ownership Report for Noncommercial Broadcast Stations (Form 323-E) to conform noncommercial educational (NCE) stations’ reporting requirements more closely to the requirements for commercial stations.  See Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services et al., Report and Order, Second Report and Order, and Order on Reconsideration, 31 FCC Rcd 398, 420-28, paras. 43-55 (2016)<br />
(2016 323 and 323-E Order); see also Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services et al.,<br />
Order on Reconsideration, FCC 17-42 (Apr. 21, 2017) (2017 323-E Order on Reconsideration) (further revising NCE filing requirements).  Pursuant to the 2016 323 and 323-E Order, NCE stations must submit biennial ownership reports pursuant to the same schedule applicable to commercial stations, including the October 1 “as of” date.  See 2016 323 and 323-E Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 432-33, paras. 64-67.  Such filings will begin during the 2017 biennial filing window.  See id.at 429, 432, paras. 58, 66; Promoting Diversification of Ownership in the Broadcasting Services, Order, 31 FCC Rcd 13263, 13263-64, paras. 1-2 (MB 2016) (suspending rolling filing deadlines for NCE stations and instead requiring all such stations to file on or before December 1, 2017).<br />
In the 2016 323 Order, the Commission noted that certain commenters had acknowledged the steps already taken to improve the quality of the broadcast ownership data, but had urged the Commission to do more to make the broadcast ownership data more usable for the benefit of studies and analysis.  See 2016 323 Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 407-08, para. 16.  The Commission, in the 2016 323 Order, made a number of significant changes to Form 323 and<br />
323-E to reduce the filing burdens on broadcasters, streamline the process, and improve data quality.  See id. at 42939, paras. 59-84. These changes included extending the biennial filing deadline, reducing the number of filings required, improving the reporting of other broadcast and newspaper interests, and other modifications.  See id.  As<br />
(continued…)</p>
<p>report must identify all of its attributable interest holders.4  Form 323 also requires all attributable interest holders to obtain and provide FCC Registration Numbers for the Commission Registration System (CORES FRNs) to facilitate the tracking and cross-referencing of reported ownership interests.5  These requirements have been in place since 2009.<br />
This report presents the results of the fourth data collection using the current version of Form 323 and reflecting attributable ownership interests as of October 1, 2015.6  On November 14, 2012, the Media Bureau released the first electronic analysis of commercial broadcast ownership data submitted pursuant to the revised biennial reporting requirements for 2009 and 2011.7  A subsequent report, released by the Bureau on June 27, 2014, contained an analysis of the commercial broadcast ownership data submitted during the 2013 filing cycle.8  The data contained in these reports are “snapshots” of the status of minority and female ownership in the broadcast industry and are part of a planned series of biennial “snapshots” that can be used for trend analysis.9  These reports provide detailed information by race, ethnicity, and gender concerning ownership of commercial television, radio, Class A television, and LPTV stations.  The Media Bureau compiled the 2015 biennial ownership filings using both algorithmic analysis and manual adjustments to obtain the best picture of ownership status and trends that the data would permit.<br />
Users of the information in this report should bear in mind that control of a licensee in the usual parlance of our cases and procedures indicates either de jure or de facto control by identifiable individuals or<br />
(Continued from previous page)<br />
noted in the 2016 323 Order, we believe these changes will improve the usability of the submitted ownership data for both Commission staff and outside analysts.  See id. at 436-39, paras. 77-84 (responding to comments on the Second 323 Report asking the Commission to make the data in future reports easier to use); see also 2014<br />
Quadrennial Regulatory Review – Review of the Commission’s Broadcast Ownership Rules and Other Rules<br />
Adopted Pursuant to Section 202 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 et al., Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Report and Order, 29 FCC Rcd 4371, 4481-87, paras. 249-62 (2014) (noting Commission efforts to address shortcomings in the Form 323 data previously identified by commenters).<br />
4	Attribution of an ownership interest to an individual or entity is governed by the Commission’s rules and, in some instances, requires a detailed case-by-case determination.  It represents the Commission’s best judgment concerning when an interest is sufficient to confer on the owner a potential degree of influence over a licensee that should be cognizable for purposes of applying the Commission’s broadcast ownership rules.  See the notes to 47 CFR § 73.3555.<br />
5	During the 2009, 2011, 2013, and 2015 biennial filing periods, commercial filers were permitted to obtain a<br />
Special Use FRN (SUFRN) for individuals (not entities) reported on the Form 323 in lieu of a CORES FRN.  The 2016 323 and 323-E Order eliminated the ability of commercial filers to provide SUFRNs for reported individuals except in very limited circumstances.  See 2016 323 and 323-E Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 412-20, 428-29, paras. 25-42, 56-59; see also 2017 323-E Order on Reconsideration at 4-9, paras. 7-14 (expanding the option for NCE filers to use SUFRNs).  For future reporting cycles, individuals reported on Form 323 will be permitted to provide either a CORES FRN or a Restricted Use FRN (RUFRN), both of which can be obtained through CORES, on Form 323.  See 2016 323 and 323-E Order, 31 FCC Rcd at 410-17, paras. 25-36.  More detail concerning these requirements is provided in the 2016 323 and 323-E Order.  See id. at 412-20, 428-29, paras. 25-42, 56-58.<br />
6	The information in this report meets the Commission’s information quality guidelines.  See Implementation of Guidelines for Ensuring and Maximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility and Integrity of Information Pursuant to Section 515 of Public Law No. 105-554, Information Quality Guidelines, 17 FCC Rcd 19890 (2002).<br />
7	See First 323 Report, 27 FCC Rcd at 13815, para. 2.<br />
8	See Second 323 Report, 29 FCC Rcd at 7836, para. 2.<br />
9	The reports collectively contain more than 100 pages of summary schedules and dozens of spreadsheets of underlying data reflecting the Media Bureau’s analysis of the Form 323 data, which can be further studied and manipulated by researchers and interested parties.  Future, similar reports are contemplated reflecting additional biennial reporting periods.<br />
groups.  Because the Bureau reports interests here that are held collectively by certain classes of individuals who may have no connection with one another beyond their shared classification by gender, ethnicity, or race, the fact that a particular class of individuals may have a majority of the voting stock or partnership interests in a licensee does not necessarily indicate control by that class of individuals.  Rather, absent a single majority interest holder, control of these stations would be determined on a de facto basis, which requires access to facts not reported on Form 323.  Accordingly, this report refers to these collective interests as “majority” interests, rather than “controlling” interests.  Similarly, of course, where no majority interest is reported, a de facto analysis would be required to determine control.   However, when a single individual, of whatever classification, holds a majority voting interest in a licensee, this would indicate de jure control by that individual and is considered a controlling interest.<br />
This document also reports the attributable positional interests  of individuals by their gender, ethnic, and racial classifications.  These individuals may exercise control of a licensee where no single individual holds a majority of the voting interests in that licensee and are more likely to do so where no attributable voting interests are identified, but this cannot be inferred from the Form 323 data alone.  As with all de facto control determinations, the specific facts of each case would be required to determine actual control.  Finally, our classification of a licensee in this report as having “No Majority Interest” does not necessarily mean that no classification of persons in this report has a majority interest in the station, only that these facts cannot be determined from the reported Form 323 data in the absence of additional information.<br />
SUMMARY OF RESULTS<br />
Overview of 2015 Broadcast Ownership Data by Gender, Ethnicity, and Race<br />
The following summary uses only data from the 2015 FCC Form 323 biennial reports and thus represents information current as of October 1, 2015 (the most current biennial information available).  A more detailed comparison between the 2015 data and 2013 data is presented separately below.<br />

Comparison of 2015 and 2013 Data for Key Categories<br />
This section presents a summary of FCC Form 323 data for 2015 by category of ownership (majority voting ownership interest, attributable ownership interest, and type of attributable interest) and gender, ethnicity, and race.  Results are reported by service, broken down into full power commercial broadcast television stations, Class A television stations, low power television stations, commercial AM radio stations, and commercial FM radio stations.17  For purposes of comparison, we also include in the summary information from our 2013 biennial ownership data.18<br />
The information is provided in Appendix C in a series of tables presenting the sources of ownership attribution.19  The first set of tables in Appendix C identifies the number of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of the same race, ethnicity, or gender holds, either individually or collectively, an attributable voting interest in the licensee that exceeds 50 percent (i.e., a majority ownership voting interest which includes voting stock in a corporation, voting interests in a partnership, or voting membership interests in a limited liability company).  The second set of tables identifies the number of stations that have at least one person with an attributable interest in the relevant race, ethnicity, or gender category.  All sources of attribution are included in this set of tables.20  The third, and final, set of tables identifies the number of stations with persons who are attributable by virtue of a positional interest, persons who hold voting interests of at least 5, 10, or 25 percent, or persons who hold a single majority voting interest.  This set of tables counts instances where an individual’s interests meets one of these criteria.  Detailed information, including market size data, is contained in the tables in Appendix C and in the accompanying Excel spreadsheets released in conjunction with this report.  Some of the information is presented in the bullets below.<br />

for Information Collection 3060-0010 (May 2013), available at <a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=201302-3060-019">http://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewDocument?ref_nbr=201302-3060-019</a>.  Filers are now able to select more than one race category for an individual.  For purposes of determining ownership interests by racial group and for consistency over the four reporting periods, this report continues to identify an individual as “two or more races” if more than one race category is selected for that individual.<br />
17	Noncommercial broadcast stations are not included in this report because, for the 2015 reporting cycle, they were not required to file the same information as commercial stations or in the same filing cycle.  Noncommercial broadcast stations were required to file Form 323-E biennially, and the version of that form used at the time of reporting did not collect information on gender, ethnicity, or race.  As noted above, the Commission recently revised Form 323-E to conform more closely reporting for noncommercial and commercial broadcast stations for future reporting periods, including the collection of information about race, gender, and ethnicity of existing, reportable attributable interest holders.  See 2016 323 Order at 420-28, paras. 43-55; see also 2017 323-E Order on Reconsideration at 4-9, paras. 7-14 (further revising NCE filing requirements).<br />

19	In addition, Appendix A provides a glossary of terms, and Appendix B contains explanatory notes regarding the 2015 data.<br />
20	All sources of attributable interests are included in this second set of tables, even though the categories are not specifically identified.  As described in footnote 9 above, all Form 323 data are publicly available to researchers as well as the general public so that any aspect of ownership by women and minorities can be examined by the public.<br />

<p>APPENDIX A Glossary of Terms<br />
Attributable ownership interest: An interest that is attributable pursuant to Note 2 of Section 73.3555 of the Commission’s rules (47 CFR § 73.3555, Note 2).<br />
Combination: This category covers situations in which there is at least one female and one male attributable station owner and the aggregate votes of the female attributable owner(s) and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owner(s) of the same ethnicity or race both separately exceed 50 percent (e.g., a station where a wife and husband, both Hispanic/Latino, each hold 100 percent as joint tenants(s)).<br />
Controlling interest:  A single individual holds a majority voting interest (i.e., more than 50 percent) in the licensee or its controlling parent or parents.<br />
Ethnicity Definition (Hispanic or Latino):  A person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish Culture or origin, regardless of race.<br />
Insufficient data to identify:  The computer code was unable to process the data submitted to the Commission in these stations’ biennial filings.<br />
Joint Female/Male: A situation in which there is at least one female and one male attributable station owner and the aggregate votes of the female attributable owner(s) and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owner(s) both separately exceed 50 percent (e.g., a station where a wife and husband each own 100 percent of the station as joint tenants).<br />
Majority interest:  A group of individuals of the same gender, ethnicity, or race, collectively hold an attributable voting interest in the licensee that exceeds 50 percent.<br />
No majority interest: No individual or group of individuals of the same race, ethnicity, or gender holds, either individually or collectively, an attributable voting interest in the licensee that exceeds 50 percent.  The computer code may have included some stations in this category if the stations’ biennial filings contained data errors or inaccuracies that caused the computer code to be unable to properly process the data submitted to the Commission.<br />
Not filed: This category includes situations where (a) the station’s licensee did not file a biennial 323 form (some of these licensees filed a 323-E form instead), or (b) the Commission’s Consolidated Database System (CDBS) was unable to accept the licensee’s filing as a result of the licensee failing to file a fee, or (c) the licensee’s filing could not be processed by the computer code.<br />
Positional Interest:  Positional interest data reported herein include all the categories listed on Form 323.  These categories are as follows: Officer, Director, General Partner, Limited Partner, LC/LLC/PLLC Member, Owner, Stockholder, Attributable Creditor, Attributable Investor, Other (please specify).  Stations with at least one person with a positional interest are reported in column one in Table 3 if the person has less than a 5 percent voting interest.<br />
Race Definitions:<br />
•	American Indian or Alaska Native:  A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North America and South America including Central America, and who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.<br />
•	Asian: A person having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or Indian Subcontinent including Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and Vietnam.<br />

•	Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander:  A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.<br />
•	Two or more races: A person having origins in two or more races.<br />
•	White:  A person having origins in any of the original peoples of Europe, the Middle East, or North Africa. <br />
APPENDIX B Explanatory Notes<br />
Description of the Tables<br />
Tables 1(a)(b)(c) identifies the number of stations for which an individual or a group of individuals of the same race, ethnicity, or gender hold, either individually or collectively, a majority of the voting interests in the licensee, that is, their voting interests exceed 50 percent.  A station identified as having no majority interest does not necessarily mean that no particular classification of persons has a majority interest in the station, only that this cannot be determined from the reported Form 323 data as submitted.  Each station is uniquely identified in this table.<br />
Tables 2(a)(b)(c) identifies the number of stations that have at least one person, by race, ethnicity, or gender, with an attributable interest.  Each station may appear in one or more categories in this table.<br />
Tables 3(a)(b)(c) identifies the number of stations that have at least one person, by race, ethnicity, or gender, with an attributable interest by virtue of a positional interest; or at least one person, by race, ethnicity, or gender, with a voting interest of at least a five percent, 10 percent, or 25 percent.  Each station may appear in one or more of these categories.  Table 3 also identifies the number of stations that have a single majority interest holder (one person holds more than 50 percent of the voting interests).<br />
Manual adjustments to the data for:<br />
Full power commercial television tables<br />
1.	Data for 2015 based on CDBS as of March 29, 2017.<br />
2.	The computer code was unable to process a number of biennial submissions due to filing errors.  These stations’ filings defaulted to “Insufficient data to identify” or “No majority interest” (NMI) categories in most instances, depending on the type of filing errors.  Commission staff manually examined a number of filings, based on the data contained in the Form 323 submissions, together with other available information, and reassigned the stations to the appropriate category in Table 1 for the purposes of this report.  In all, 397 stations in Table 1 were reassigned to White, non-Hispanic/Latino male; 15 stations were reassigned to White, non-Hispanic/Latino female; one station was reassigned to White, Hispanic/Latino male; five stations were reassigned to Black/African American, non-Hispanic/Latino male; and 437 stations were reassigned to NMI.  Table 1 reflects these reassignments.  Commission staff did not reassign any stations reported in Tables 2 and 3.<br />
3.	The computer code was unable to account for ownership combinations where the aggregate votes of neither gender exceed 50 percent, but the aggregate votes of the female attributable owner(s) and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owner(s) of the same race together exceed 50 percent.  In such cases the stations are identified as no majority interest in Table 1.  Two stations that met these criteria were reassigned to Black/African American combination, non-Hispanic/Latino combination, and joint male/female in Table 1.<br />
Class A television tables<br />
1.	Data for 2015 based on CDBS as of March 31, 2017.<br />
2.	The computer code was unable to process a number of biennial submissions due to filing errors.  These stations’ filings defaulted to “Insufficient data to identify” or “No majority interest” (NMI) categories in most instances, depending on the type of filing errors.  Commission staff manually examined a number of filings, based on the data contained in the Form 323 submissions, together with other available information, and reassigned the stations to the appropriate category in Table 1 for the purposes of this report.  In all, 63 stations in Table 1 were reassigned to White, non-Hispanic/Latino male, and 39 stations were reassigned to NMI.  Table 1 reflects these reassignments.  Commission staff did not reassign any stations reported in Tables 2 and 3.<br />
Low power television tables<br />
1.	Data for 2015 based on CDBS as of April 10, 2017.<br />
2.	The computer code was unable to process a number of biennial submissions due to filing errors.  These stations’ filings defaulted to “Insufficient data to identify” or “No majority interest” (NMI) categories in most instances, depending on the type of filing errors.  Commission staff manually examined a number of filings, many of which fell into these categories, based on the data contained in the Form 323 submissions, together with other available information, and reassigned the stations to the appropriate category in Table 1 for the purposes of this report.  In some cases, this involved moving certain stations that were missing one or more reports into the proper ownership categories based on staff analysis of the ownership of commonly-owned stations.  In all, 168 stations in Table 1 were reassigned to White, nonHispanic/Latino male; one station was reassigned to White, non-Hispanic/Latino female; and 83 stations were reassigned to NMI.  Table 1 reflects these reassignments.  Commission staff did not reassign any stations reported in Tables 2 and 3.<br />
3.	The computer code was unable to account for ownership combinations where the aggregate votes of neither gender exceed 50 percent, but the aggregate votes of the female attributable owner(s) and the aggregate votes of the male attributable owner(s) of the same race together exceed 50 percent.  In such cases the stations are identified as no majority interest in Table 1.  One station that met these criteria was reassigned to Black/African American combination, non-Hispanic/Latino combination, and joint male/female in Table 1.<br />
4.	The response rate in 2015 for LPTV stations is 69 percent, up from 66 percent in 2013 and 60 percent in 2011.  It appears that, because many LPTV stations, like television translators, merely rebroadcast the signal of another TV station, they are under the mistaken impression that they, like television translators, are exempt from the Form 323 biennial filing requirement.  We remind licensees that the Form 323 filing requirement applies to stations based on regulatory classification.  Accordingly, stations classified as LPTV stations must submit biennial ownership reports regardless of whether or not they originate programming.<br />
Commercial AM radio station tables<br />
1.	Data for 2015 based on CDBS as of March 21, 2017.<br />
2.	The computer code was unable to process a number of biennial submissions due to filing errors.  These stations’ filings defaulted to “Insufficient data to identify” or “No majority interest” (NMI) categories in most instances, depending on the type of filing errors.  Commission staff manually examined many of the filings for stations that fell into these categories based on the data contained in the Form 323 submissions, together with other available information, and reassigned the stations to the appropriate category in Table<br />
1 for the purposes of this report.  In all, 86 stations in Table 1 were reassigned to White, nonHispanic/Latino male; five stations were reassigned to White, non-Hispanic/Latino female; and 28 stations were reassigned to NMI.  Table 1 reflects these reassignments.  Commission staff did not reassign any stations reported in Tables 2 and 3.<br />
3.  Our CDBS data provides us with a single total for all licensed AM stations that includes both commercial and noncommercial, educational stations. A number of AM radio stations (approximately 203) are licensed as noncommercial, educational stations. Because these stations are required to file a<br />
Form 323-E ownership report rather than a Form 323, we have excluded these 203 stations from our AM station totals for “not filed” and “all licensed” stations in the 2015 tables so these figures more closely reflect only those commercial AM stations that fall into these categories.<br />
Commercial FM radio station tables<br />
1.	Data for 2015 based on CDBS as of March 21, 2017.<br />
2.	The computer code was unable to process a number of biennial submissions due to filing errors.  These stations’ filings defaulted to “Insufficient data to identify” or “No majority interest” (NMI) categories in most instances, depending on the type of filing errors.  Commission staff manually examined many of the filings for stations that fell into these categories based on the data contained in the Form 323 submissions, together with other available information, and reassigned the stations to the appropriate category in Table 1 for the purposes of this report.  In all, 236 stations in Table 1 were reassigned to White, non-<br />
Hispanic/Latino male; seven stations were reassigned to White, non-Hispanic/Latino female; two stations were reassigned to White, Hispanic/Latino male; and 42 stations were reassigned to NMI.  Table 1 reflects these reassignments.  Commission staff did not reassign any stations reported in Tables 2 and 3.</p>
